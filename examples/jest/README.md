# NVDA snapshot testing

An example using jest as a test runner.

## Installation

- node 14.x
- install dependencies via `yarn`
- NVDA `2020.2`

## Getting started

1. Open a PowerShell
2. Replace the commands found in `test.example.ps1`
   Executing `test.example.ps1` directly (with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`) will not bring the opened browser window to the front.
