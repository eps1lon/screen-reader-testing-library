# NVDA snapshot testing

Check out [`index.js`](./index.js) for using `screen-reader-testing-library` with `node`.

## Installation

- Windows with powershell
- node 14.x
- install dependencies via `yarn`

## Getting started

1. Open a PowerShell
2. Replace the commands found in `test.example.ps1`
   Executing `test.example.ps1` directly (with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`) will not bring the opened browser window to the front.
