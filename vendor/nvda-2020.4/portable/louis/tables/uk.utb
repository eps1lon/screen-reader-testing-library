# Ukrainian braille is largely the same as Russian braille
include ru-litbrl.ctb

# The Ukrainian alphabet has 4 letters that are not in the Russian
# alphabet, namely Є, І, Ї and Ґ. Like in ru-chardefs.cti, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters.
uplow \x0404\x0454 3459    CYRILLIC LETTER IE   Єє
uplow \x0406\x0456 134569  CYRILLIC LETTER I    Іі
uplow \x0407\x0457 14569   CYRILLIC LETTER II   Її
uplow \x0490\x0491 124569  CYRILLIC LETTER GE   Ґґ

# Extend classes defined in ru-litbrl.ctb
attribute uppercyrillic \x0404\x0406\x0407\x0490
attribute lowercyrillic \x0454\x0456\x0457\x0491

# The Russian alphabet also has 4 letters that are not in the
# Ukrainian alphabet, namely Ё, Ъ, Ы and Э. For convenience these
# definitions are not removed however. They're needed to work
# comfortable with both languages. These 4 Russian letters are defined
# in ru-chardefs.cti as follows:

# uplow \x0401\x0451 169        CYRILLIC LETTER IO          Ё
# uplow \x042A\x044A 123569     CYRILLIC LETTER HARD SIGN   Ъ
# uplow \x042B\x044B 23469      CYRILLIC LETTER YERU        Ы
# uplow \x042D\x044D 2469       CYRILLIC LETTER E           Э
