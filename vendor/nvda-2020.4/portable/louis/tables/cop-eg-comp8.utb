# Coptic language was the native Egyptian language before the Arabic
# conquest, but is now mainly used in the Coptic church liturgy and
# for biblical studies.

## About Coptic Braille:

# The Coptic language is based on the Greek alphabet + eight more
# letters derived from Ancient Egyptian Demotic script. The whole
# alphabet is used as the Coptic/Egyptian alphabet.

# In Braille, we used the standard form of the Greek letters in
# addition to eight newly formed letters specific to the extra eight
# Coptic letters.

# When we started writing the first Coptic transcriber to emboss
# Coptic Braille in 2009 we searched but found no authentic documents.
# Coptic alphabet was merely handed down from one generation of
# Church's cantors to the next. Most probably, it originated during
# the 1930's or before it as some Canters said ... At the time, a
# cantor would write down whatever he needed manually. But there was
# no establishment, ecclesiastical or academic, that printed Coptic in
# Braille.

# The Bishopric of Youth, under the auspices of His Grace, Bishop
# Mousa, of the Coptic Orthodox Church, is an official Coptic
# organization.

# We have developed a Coptic table for transcribing liturgical books
# since 2009, and before that date Coptic was written in Braille
# manually / individually.

# This computer Braille table is to be used with Braille Displays. It
# contains Coptic, Arabic & English. We will add as many more
# languages as we can, to help all Coptic blind people, in any
# nationality, to use Coptic either in church or for study.
